# Movies Watchlist

This is the solo project from Module 9 (Working with APIs), Part 3 (Async JavaScript) of Scrimba's [Frontend Developer Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend). The project used the `fetch` API to get data from the OMDB (Open Movie Database) and allow visitors to search for films by title or keyword, get a list of results and add them to a watchlist that's saved locally in localStorage.
